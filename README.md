MovieDb is an application that scan your movies file collection and collect info from the web (themoviedb.org) and gives you a nice gui.
It has also a server running a minimal api to interact with it.

It's written in python and by now some parts in php.
It's born essentially as an experiment to improve my python and php skills and as a need to handle my movie collection files stored in my home sheevaplug server and shared with roommates.
